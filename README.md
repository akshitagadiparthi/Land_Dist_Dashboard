## **1. Project Description**
- **The Agricultural Distribution of India dashboard provides an interactive visualization of land distribution across different states in India based on factors such as land holdings, crop types, and land size classification. This dashboard enables policymakers, researchers, and agricultural professionals to analyze the distribution of land holdings, the most prominent crops per state, and the categorization of land holdings into institutional, large, medium, small, and marginal holdings.**

## **2. Key questions answered by this dashboard include:**
- Which state has the highest number of land holdings?
- What crops grow in which states?
- What is the size-wise segregation of land holdings per state?
  
## **3. Technologies Used**
- Tableau – For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- SQL – Used for data extraction and transformation.
- Excel/CSV – Data sources were processed and imported from spreadsheets.
- GitHub – For version control and project hosting (if applicable).
